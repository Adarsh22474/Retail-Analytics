# Retail Analytics Project

A complete end-to-end retail analytics solution built using **SQL** and **Power BI**, focusing on data auditing, sales insights, customer behaviour, product performance, store comparison, and retention analysis. This project transforms raw retail data into clear, actionable business insights.

## Overview

This project performs a full retail analytics workflow, including:

* Data quality audit in SQL
* Data cleaning and modelling
* Creation of analytical tables
* Development of an interactive Power BI dashboard
* Insight generation across sales, customers, products, stores, and retention

The analysis reveals revenue drivers, operational gaps, customer satisfaction trends, and retention challenges.

## Features

### Data Audit & Modelling (SQL)

* Primary key validation
* Foreign key consistency checks
* Removal of duplicate records
* Outlier detection for price and quantity
* Creation of clean, analysis-ready tables

### Analytical Insights

* Monthly, weekday, and time-of-day sales trends
* Category and subcategory performance with Pareto behaviour
* Store-level performance variance
* Customer satisfaction and rating analysis across states
* Cohort analysis revealing steep Month-1 retention drop
* Identification of improvement opportunities in low-performing regions and stores

---

## Key Insights

* A small set of categories and products contribute a majority of revenue.
* Sales peak during the first half of the day.
* Certain states such as Uttar Pradesh and J&K show strong customer satisfaction, while Himachal, Uttarakhand, and West Bengal underperform.
* Store performance varies widely, indicating inventory, demand, or operational gaps.
* Retention drops sharply after Month 1, highlighting the need for structured follow-ups.

---

## Recommendations

* Implement strong post-purchase engagement within the first 30 days.
* Optimize inventory allocation to high-performing categories.
* Improve service quality and operational efficiency in low-performing states/stores.
* Launch weekday-specific offers to address low-demand days.
* Reassess pricing and discount structures for profitability.
